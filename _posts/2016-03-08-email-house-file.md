# Email House File

A well maintained email file can prove to be invaluable for both fundraising and activism. We have experience managing email files ranging from 20,000 to 2,000,000 names. Are you managing your file correctly? Do words like testing, segmenting, converting, and targeting scare you? We can help make sense of it all!
