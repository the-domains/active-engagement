Eric is a native of Midlothian, Virginia, a south side suburb of Richmond.

He attended the University of Virginia, where he earned Bachelor's degrees in Political Science and American History. While a student at The University, Eric was an active leader in both the UVA chapter of Campus Crusade for Christ and the Cavalier Marching Band.

Upon graduation, Eric joined the development department of American Majority, a 501(c)3 organization dedicated to identifying and training a "farm team" of future conservative leaders at the local and state levels. There, he composed the bulk of the organization's written content and managed the direct mail fundraising program. After two years at American Majority, Eric became an Account Manager at ActiveEngagement. As such, he assists clients with their day-to-day fundraising and marketing needs.

Eric lives in the heart of Historic Downtown Leesburg, Virginia with his wife, Carmen. They enjoy traveling, tasting wine, and cooking delicious food.
