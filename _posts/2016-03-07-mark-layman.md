Mark Layman is a lifelong Virginian having grown up in Leesburg. He attended Virginia Tech and graduated from the Pamplin School of Business with a degree in Finance in 2000\. In his studies, Mark focused on Risk Management and Venture Capital. He was an active member of the Delta Chi Fraternity and remains a member of the Virginia Tech Alumni Association.

After graduation, Mark worked as a financial analyst for Cambridge Associates in Arlington, Virginia. As an analyst, he worked with non-profit organizations to meet their financial goals.
