## Chief Technology Officer

Brian was raised in the shadow of the nation's capital near Alexandria, Virginia, but after college settled in the beautiful Shenandoah Valley.  He is a graduate of James Madison University, where he studied Religion, Philosophy and Music.  He was first introduced to programming in grade school and was doing networking and database consulting in high school, but really found a calling in technology after discovering the Internet while interning at the Naval Research Laboratory in 1992\.

After graduating in 1996, Brian started his first company; a boutique web design firm that he owned until 2004\.  In 1999 he founded a broadband ISP, and has done extensive work as a technology consultant and strategist for small businesses.  He has worked with startups managing development, leading efforts to build out advertising platforms, integrating with early social networks, and developing server infrastructures to handle massive scaling for file sharing services.  He also taught web design at James Madison University.

Brian has been an active leader in technology and education.  He was a founding member of the Shenandoah Valley Technology Council and served on the board for the first 5 years of the organization.  He serves on curriculum advisory boards at Blue Ridge Community College, Bridgewater College, and the Woodrow Wilson Rehabilitation Center.
